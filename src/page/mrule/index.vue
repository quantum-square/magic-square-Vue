    In recreational mathematics, a square array of numbers, usually positive integers, is called a <b>magic square</b>
    if the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are the same. The order of the magic
    square is the number of integers along one side (n), and the constant sum is called the magic constant. If the array
    includes just the positive integers {\displaystyle 1,2,...,n^{2}}{\displaystyle 1,2,...,n^{2}}, the magic square is
    said to be normal. Some authors take magic square to mean normal magic square.<br/>
    <br/>
    Magic squares that include repeated entries do not fall under this definition and are referred to as trivial. Some
    well-known examples, including the Sagrada Fam√≠lia magic square and the Parker square are trivial in this sense.
    When all the rows and columns but not both diagonals sum to the magic constant we have semimagic squares (sometimes
    called orthomagic squares).
